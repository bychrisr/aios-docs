### Playbooks and AI Audit

In addition to the official documentation, you will find the **Playbooks**: original content on this site, manually created to offer practical and opinionated guides.

To ensure these guides remain relevant, they are continuously audited by an AI agent that compares them with the latest updates from `aios-core`. Inconsistencies or improvement suggestions are automatically opened as *issues* in our [public repository](https://github.com/SynkraAI/aios-docs), treating content quality as a software process.
