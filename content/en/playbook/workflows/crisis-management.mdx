# Crisis Management (War Room)

Procedures for handling critical production issues.

## Trigger Conditions

- Production down or severely degraded
- Data loss or security breach
- Critical business function unavailable

## War Room Protocol

### 1. Assemble

Activate key agents:
```
@devops  — Infrastructure and deployment
@dev     — Code investigation and fixes
@qa      — Verification and regression testing
```

### 2. Triage

1. Identify the symptom (what users see)
2. Check recent deployments (`git log --oneline -10`)
3. Check infrastructure status
4. Check external service status

### 3. Containment

Options (in order of preference):
1. **Rollback** — Revert to last known good deployment
2. **Feature Flag** — Disable problematic feature
3. **Hotfix** — Minimal code change to restore service

### 4. Fix

```
@dev *develop hotfix-{issue}
```

Use YOLO mode for speed. Skip story creation for P0 issues.

### 5. Verify

```
@qa *qa-gate
```

Ensure fix resolves the issue without regressions.

### 6. Deploy

```
@devops *push --expedite
```

### 7. Post-Mortem

After resolution:
1. Document timeline of events
2. Identify root cause
3. Create preventive stories
4. Update monitoring/alerts
