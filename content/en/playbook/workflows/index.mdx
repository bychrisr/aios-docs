# Workflow Guides

Step-by-step guides for common AIOS workflows. Each guide explains when to use the workflow, which agents are involved, and the commands to run at each stage.

## Project Workflows

These workflows cover end-to-end project lifecycles:

- **[Greenfield Project](/playbook/workflows/greenfield-project)** -- Starting a new project from scratch. Covers all three variants: full-stack, service/API, and UI-only, including environment bootstrap, discovery, planning, and the development cycle.

- **[Brownfield Project](/playbook/workflows/brownfield-project)** -- Joining or enhancing an existing codebase. Covers the 10-phase Brownfield Discovery assessment and the three implementation variants for existing projects.

## Development Workflows

These workflows cover the day-to-day development process:

- **[Sprint Planning](/playbook/workflows/sprint-planning)** -- Planning and executing weekly sprints. Covers epic creation, story validation, estimation, velocity tracking, and retrospectives.

- **[PR Workflow](/playbook/workflows/pr-workflow)** -- The standard pull request process. Covers @devops push/merge, CodeRabbit integration, self-healing loops, and QA gate decisions.

## Operational Workflows

- **[Crisis Management](/playbook/workflows/crisis-management)** -- War room procedures for critical production issues. Covers severity classification, escalation triggers, hotfix workflows, rollback procedures, and post-mortem documentation.

## Choosing the Right Workflow

| Situation | Recommended Workflow |
|-----------|---------------------|
| New project, no existing code | [Greenfield Project](/playbook/workflows/greenfield-project) |
| Existing project, need assessment | [Brownfield Project](/playbook/workflows/brownfield-project) (Discovery) |
| Adding features to existing project | [Brownfield Project](/playbook/workflows/brownfield-project) (Implementation) |
| Weekly development cadence | [Sprint Planning](/playbook/workflows/sprint-planning) |
| Code ready to ship | [PR Workflow](/playbook/workflows/pr-workflow) |
| Production incident | [Crisis Management](/playbook/workflows/crisis-management) |
| Simple bug fix | [Sprint Planning](/playbook/workflows/sprint-planning) (SDC in YOLO mode) |
