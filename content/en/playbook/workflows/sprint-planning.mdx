# Sprint Planning (Weekly)

Guide for planning and executing weekly sprints with AIOS.

## Before the Sprint

1. Review the backlog: `@po` reviews prioritized stories
2. Select stories for the sprint based on capacity
3. Ensure all selected stories are in `Ready` status

## Sprint Kickoff

```
@pm *execute-epic {epic-id}
```

This initiates the epic execution workflow, processing stories in order.

## During the Sprint

### Daily Flow
1. `@dev *develop {story-id}` — Pick up next story
2. Implement following the story's acceptance criteria
3. `@qa *qa-gate` — Run quality checks
4. `@devops *push` — Ship when approved

### Handling Blockers
- If blocked by a dependency: `@sm` updates story status
- If QA fails: `@qa *qa-loop` starts iterative fix cycle
- If scope changes: `@po *validate-story-draft` re-validates

## Sprint Review

1. Review completed stories vs. planned
2. Run `@qa` final verification on all completed work
3. Document learnings in retrospective

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Stories completed | ≥ 80% of planned |
| QA pass rate (first attempt) | ≥ 70% |
| Cycle time per story | Decreasing trend |
