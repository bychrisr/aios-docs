# Greenfield Project

Starting a new project from scratch with AIOS.

## Step 1: Initialize

```bash
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
git init
npx @synkra/aios-cli init
```

## Step 2: Architecture

```
@architect *create-full-stack-architecture
```

Follow the interactive workflow to define:
- Tech stack selection
- Project structure
- Deployment strategy
- Testing approach

## Step 3: Epic Planning

```
@pm *create-epic
```

Break the architecture into epics with stories.

## Step 4: Story Development

For each story in priority order:

1. `@sm *draft` — Create the story
2. `@po *validate-story-draft` — Validate (GO/NO-GO)
3. `@dev *develop {story-id}` — Implement
4. `@qa *qa-gate` — Quality check
5. `@devops *push` — Ship

## Step 5: Iterate

Continue through stories, using:
- `*qa-loop` for iterative fixes
- Sprint planning for weekly cadence
- Retrospectives for continuous improvement
