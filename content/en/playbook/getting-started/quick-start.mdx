# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with AIOS in 5 steps.

## Step 1: Initialize AIOS

In your project root:

```bash
npx @synkra/aios-core init
```

This bootstraps the `.aios-core/` directory with all framework files, agents, tasks, and workflows.

## Step 2: Activate Your First Agent

In Claude Code (or your AI IDE):

```
@dev
```

This activates Dex, the Developer agent, with all development capabilities. You can address any of the 12 agents by their handle.

## Step 3: Run Your First Command

```
*help
```

Shows all available commands for the active agent. Every agent supports `*help`, `*status`, and `*guide`.

## Step 4: Create Your First Story

Activate River, the Scrum Master, and draft a story:

```
@sm *draft
```

Follow the interactive prompts to create your first development story. The output is a `{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md` file with status `Draft`.

Then validate it with Pax, the Product Owner:

```
@po *validate-story-draft
```

A score of ≥ 7/10 moves the story from `Draft` to `Ready`.

## Step 5: Start Developing

With a story in `Ready` status:

```
@dev *develop story-1.1
```

Dex guides you through implementation in Interactive mode by default. CodeRabbit automatically scans and self-heals CRITICAL and HIGH issues.

When implementation is complete:

```
@qa *qa-gate
```

Quinn runs the 7-point quality gate. On PASS, ship with:

```
@devops *push
```

Only Gage (@devops) can push — all other agents delegate push operations to him.
