# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with AIOS in minutes.

## Step 1: Initialize AIOS

In your project root:

```bash
npx @synkra/aios-core init
```

This bootstraps the `.aios-core/` directory with all framework files.

## Step 2: Activate Your First Agent

In Claude Code (or your AI IDE), type:

```
@dev
```

This activates the Developer agent (Dex) with all development capabilities.

## Step 3: Run Your First Command

```
*help
```

Shows all available commands for the active agent.

## Step 4: Create Your First Story

Activate the Scrum Master:

```
@sm *draft
```

Follow the interactive prompts to create your first development story.

## Step 5: Start Developing

With a story created and validated:

```
@dev *develop story-1.1
```

The developer agent will guide you through implementation.
