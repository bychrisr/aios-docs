# Onboarding in 60 Minutes

A structured walkthrough to become productive with Synkra AIOS in one hour. By the end, you will have installed the framework, activated agents, created your first story, run the full SDC workflow, and passed a quality gate.

---

## Minute 0-10: Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** 20.0.0 or higher
- **npm** 8.0.0 or higher
- **Git** installed and configured
- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) installed (for push/PR workflows)
- An AI IDE — **Claude Code** (recommended), Cursor, or VS Code with AI extensions

### Install AIOS

```bash
# Create a new project
npx @synkra/aios-core init my-first-project

# Navigate to your project
cd my-first-project
```

### Verify Installation

Check that the `.aios-core/` directory was created:

```
my-first-project/
  .aios-core/          # Framework configuration, agents, tasks, workflows
  docs/
    stories/           # Story files will be saved here
```

### Configure Your Environment

Edit the `.env` file with your AI provider key:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
# or
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

## Minute 10-20: Understanding the Framework

### Core Concepts

AIOS orchestrates 12 named specialized agents through structured workflows. Each agent has:

- A **handle** (e.g., `@dev`) you use to address it
- A **name** (e.g., Dex) for its persona
- Defined **authority boundaries** — what it can and cannot do
- A set of **commands** it responds to

### Essential Commands (Any Agent)

```bash
*help      # Show all available commands
*status    # Display current context, story state, and agent
*guide     # Show detailed usage guide for the active agent
```

### The 12 Agents

| Handle | Name | Role |
|--------|------|------|
| `@dev` | Dex | Software implementation |
| `@qa` | Quinn | Quality gates |
| `@po` | Pax | Story validation |
| `@pm` | Morgan | Epics and spec pipeline |
| `@sm` | River | Story creation |
| `@architect` | Aria | System architecture |
| `@analyst` | Atlas | Research |
| `@ux-design-expert` | Uma | UX/Design |
| `@data-engineer` | Dara | Database |
| `@devops` | Gage | CI/CD and Git push |
| `@docs` | Ajax | Documentation |
| `@aios-master` | Orion | Framework orchestration |

For full details on each agent, see [Agents at a Glance](/playbook/agents).

## Minute 20-35: Agent Activation and Your First Story

### Activate an Agent

Address agents directly to activate them:

```bash
@sm *help      # Activate River and see available commands
@dev *help     # Activate Dex
```

### Agent Authority Boundaries

A critical AIOS concept: agents have strict authority limits.

- @dev can `git add`, `git commit` — but **cannot** `git push` (delegate to @devops)
- @po can validate stories — but **cannot** edit acceptance criteria after validation
- Only @devops (Gage) can `git push`, `gh pr create`, and `gh pr merge`

### Phase 1: Create Your First Story (@sm — River)

```bash
@sm *draft
```

River guides you through creating a story with title, description, acceptance criteria, and scope. The output is a `{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md` file with status `Draft`.

### Phase 2: Validate the Story (@po — Pax)

```bash
@po *validate-story-draft
```

Pax runs the **10-point validation checklist**:

| # | Check |
|---|-------|
| 1 | Clear and objective title |
| 2 | Complete description |
| 3 | Testable acceptance criteria |
| 4 | Well-defined scope (IN/OUT) |
| 5 | Dependencies mapped |
| 6 | Complexity estimate |
| 7 | Business value stated |
| 8 | Risks documented |
| 9 | Definition of Done |
| 10 | Alignment with PRD/Epic |

**Decision:**
- **GO** (≥ 7/10) — Story status changes from `Draft` to `Ready`
- **NO-GO** (less than 7) — Required fixes listed; story stays `Draft`

---

## Minute 35-50: Running the Story Development Cycle (SDC)

### The 4-Phase SDC

| Phase | Agent | What Happens |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| 1. Create | @sm (River) | Story drafted from epic/PRD |
| 2. Validate | @po (Pax) | 10-point checklist, GO/NO-GO |
| 3. Implement | @dev (Dex) | Code written, CodeRabbit self-healing |
| 4. QA Gate | @qa (Quinn) | 7-point quality check, verdict |

### Phase 3: Implement (@dev — Dex)

```bash
@dev *develop story-1.1
```

Dex works in one of three execution modes:

| Mode | Prompts | Best For |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Interactive** (default) | 5-10, with checkpoints | Learning, complex decisions |
| **YOLO** | 0-1, fully autonomous | Simple tasks |
| **Pre-Flight** | 10-15 upfront, then zero | Ambiguous requirements |

During implementation, **CodeRabbit** scans automatically:
- CRITICAL and HIGH issues are auto-fixed (up to 2 iterations in dev phase)
- MEDIUM issues are documented as technical debt
- LOW issues are ignored

---

## Minute 50-60: Quality Gates and Shipping

### Phase 4: QA Gate (@qa — Quinn)

```bash
@qa *qa-gate
```

Quinn checks 7 quality dimensions:

| # | Check |
|---|-------|
| 1 | Code review (patterns, readability) |
| 2 | Unit tests (coverage, all passing) |
| 3 | Acceptance criteria (all met) |
| 4 | No regressions |
| 5 | Performance within limits |
| 6 | Security (OWASP basics) |
| 7 | Documentation (updated if needed) |

**Possible verdicts:** PASS, CONCERNS, FAIL, WAIVED

### If FAIL — Start the QA Loop

```bash
*qa-loop story-1.1       # Start automated review-fix cycle
# Max 5 iterations: @qa reviews → @dev fixes → @qa re-reviews
```

### Ship Your Changes (@devops — Gage)

```bash
@devops *push
```

Only Gage can push. This is by design — all agents coordinate through this single gate for remote operations.

### What You Accomplished

In 60 minutes you have:

- Installed and configured Synkra AIOS
- Learned the 12 agents, their names, and authority boundaries
- Created and validated your first story (SDC Phases 1-2)
- Implemented with CodeRabbit self-healing (Phase 3)
- Passed a quality gate (Phase 4)
- Shipped your changes via @devops
