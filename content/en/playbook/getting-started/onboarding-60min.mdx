# Onboarding in 60 Minutes

A structured walkthrough to become productive with AIOS in one hour.

## Phase 1: Setup (10 min)

1. Ensure you have Node.js 18+, Git, and GitHub CLI installed
2. Initialize AIOS in your project: `npx @synkra/aios-cli init`
3. Verify the `.aios-core/` directory was created
4. Open your AI IDE (Claude Code recommended)

## Phase 2: Agent Exploration (15 min)

1. Activate each key agent and run `*help`:
   - `@dev *help` — Developer commands
   - `@architect *help` — Architecture commands
   - `@sm *help` — Story management commands
   - `@qa *help` — Quality assurance commands

2. Understand agent boundaries:
   - @dev can commit but cannot push
   - @devops handles all push/deploy operations
   - @po validates stories, @sm creates them

## Phase 3: Create a Story (15 min)

1. `@sm *draft` — Create your first story
2. `@po *validate-story-draft` — Validate the story
3. Review the generated story file in `docs/stories/`

## Phase 4: Implement (15 min)

1. `@dev *develop {story-id}` — Start implementation
2. Follow the interactive development flow
3. `@qa *qa-gate` — Run quality checks

## Phase 5: Review & Ship (5 min)

1. Review changes with `git diff`
2. `@devops *push` — Push to remote
