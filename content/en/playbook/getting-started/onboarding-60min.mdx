# Onboarding in 60 Minutes

A structured walkthrough to become productive with Synkra AIOS in one hour. By the end, you will have installed the framework, activated agents, created your first story, run a workflow, and passed a quality gate.

## Minute 0-10: Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** version 18.0.0 or higher
- **npm** version 6.0.0 or higher
- **Git** installed and configured
- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) installed (for push/PR workflows)
- An AI IDE such as **Claude Code** (recommended), Cursor, or VS Code with AI extensions

### Install AIOS

```bash
# Create a new project
npx @synkra/aios-core init my-first-project

# Navigate to your project
cd my-first-project
```

### Verify Installation

Check that the `.aios-core/` directory was created with the expected structure:

```
my-first-project/
  .aios-core/             # Framework configuration and agents
  agents/                 # AI agents directory
  workflows/              # Automated workflows
  tasks/                  # Reusable tasks
  .env                    # Environment variables (configure your API key)
```

### Configure Your Environment

Edit the `.env` file with your AI provider key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
# or
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
```

## Minute 10-20: Understanding the Meta-Agent

### Start the Meta-Agent

```bash
npx @synkra/aios-core
```

### Core Concepts

The **meta-agent** is the heart of AIOS. It is an AI that understands its own codebase and orchestrates specialized agents to handle different aspects of development.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Self-Analysis** -- Examines the project code structure
- **Code Generation** -- Creates components following learned patterns
- **Pattern Learning** -- Adapts to your team's development style
- **Workflow Orchestration** -- Coordinates agents through structured workflows

### Essential Commands

Try these commands to get oriented:

```bash
*help                    # Show all available commands
*status                  # Display system status
*list-agents             # Show all available agents
*config                  # View current configuration
```

### The 13 Agents

AIOS comes with 13 specialized agents. The most important ones to know right away:

| Agent | Role | Key Command |
|-------|------|-------------|
| @dev (Dex) | Software development | `@dev *develop {story-id}` |
| @sm (River) | Story creation | `@sm *draft` |
| @po (Pax) | Story validation | `@po *validate-story-draft` |
| @qa | Quality assurance | `@qa *qa-gate` |
| @devops (Gage) | Push and deployment | `@devops *push` |
| @architect (Aria) | System design | `@architect *create-full-stack-architecture` |
| @pm (Morgan) | Epic and project management | `@pm *create-epic` |

---

## Minute 20-35: Agent Activation and Your First Story

### Activate an Agent

Agents are activated by addressing them directly:

```bash
@sm *help      # Activate the Scrum Master and see available commands
@dev *help     # Activate the Developer agent
```

### Understand Agent Boundaries

An important concept in AIOS: agents have **authority boundaries**.

- @dev can `git commit` but **cannot** `git push` (delegate to @devops)
- @po can validate stories but **cannot** edit acceptance criteria after validation
- Only @devops can create PRs and push to remote

### Create Your First Story

```bash
# Step 1: Create a story draft
@sm *draft
```

The Scrum Master will guide you through creating a story file with title, description, acceptance criteria, and scope.

```bash
# Step 2: Validate the story
@po *validate-story-draft
```

The Product Owner runs the 10-point checklist. If the score is ≥ 7/10, the story moves from `Draft` to `Ready`.

```bash
# Step 3: Review the generated story file
# Stories are saved in docs/stories/
```

## Minute 35-50: Running a Workflow (SDC)

### The Story Development Cycle

The SDC is the primary workflow in AIOS, with 4 phases:

| Phase | Agent | What Happens |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| 1. Create | @sm | Story drafted from epic/PRD |
| 2. Validate | @po | 10-point checklist, GO/NO-GO decision |
| 3. Implement | @dev | Code written, CodeRabbit self-healing |
| 4. QA Gate | @qa | 7-point quality check, verdict |

### Implement Your Story

```bash
# Start implementation (interactive mode by default)
@dev *develop {story-id}
```

The developer agent works in one of three modes:

- **Interactive** (default) -- 5-10 prompts with checkpoints and confirmations
- **YOLO** -- Autonomous execution with 0-1 prompts; decisions logged automatically
- **Pre-Flight** -- All questions asked upfront, then zero-ambiguity execution

During implementation, CodeRabbit automatically scans for issues:
- CRITICAL and HIGH severity issues are auto-fixed (up to 2 iterations)
- MEDIUM issues are documented as technical debt
- LOW issues are ignored

---

## Minute 50-60: Quality Gates and Next Steps

### Run the QA Gate

```bash
@qa *qa-gate
```

The QA agent checks 7 quality dimensions:

1. Code review (patterns, readability)
2. Unit tests (coverage, all passing)
3. Acceptance criteria (all met)
4. No regressions
5. Performance
6. Security (OWASP basics)
7. Documentation

**Possible verdicts:** PASS, CONCERNS, FAIL, WAIVED

### Ship Your Changes

If the QA gate passes:

```bash
# Review your changes
git diff

# Push to remote (only @devops can do this)
@devops *push
```

### What You Accomplished

In 60 minutes you have:

- Installed and configured Synkra AIOS
- Learned the meta-agent concept and essential commands
- Activated agents and understood authority boundaries
- Created and validated your first story
- Run the Story Development Cycle with CodeRabbit integration
- Passed a quality gate and shipped your changes
