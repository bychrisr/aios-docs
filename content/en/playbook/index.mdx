## What Is AIOS?

Synkra AIOS is an AI-powered development framework that orchestrates 12 specialized agents through structured workflows. Instead of a general-purpose AI assistant, AIOS gives each role a named agent with defined authority, commands, and quality gates.

Every feature follows the same lifecycle: a Scrum Master creates the story, a Product Owner validates it, a Developer implements it, a QA agent verifies it, and a DevOps agent ships it. Each agent knows its boundaries and delegates to others when needed.

## The 4 Core Workflows

| Workflow | When to Use | Entry Point |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Story Development Cycle (SDC)** | All development work | `@sm *draft` → `@po *validate-story-draft` → `@dev *develop` → `@qa *qa-gate` → `@devops *push` |
| **QA Loop** | Iterative review after QA gate | `*qa-loop {storyId}` |
| **Spec Pipeline** | Complex features needing formal spec | `@pm *create-epic` → `@pm *execute-epic` |
| **Brownfield Discovery** | Joining an existing codebase | `@architect *create-full-stack-architecture` |
