## Full Story Development Cycle (SDC)

The complete 4-phase workflow from story creation to shipping:

```
# Phase 1 — Create (Scrum Master)
@sm *draft

# Phase 2 — Validate (Product Owner)
@po *validate-story-draft
# GO = ≥ 7/10 → status moves Draft → Ready
# NO-GO = < 7/10 → fix and retry

# Phase 3 — Implement (Developer)
@dev *develop {story-id}

# Phase 4 — QA Gate (QA Agent)
@qa *qa-gate
# Verdicts: PASS | CONCERNS | FAIL | WAIVED

# Ship (DevOps — only @devops can push)
@devops *push
```

---

## QA & Quality

```
@qa *qa-gate                   # Run 7-point quality gate on current story
*qa-loop {storyId}             # Start automated review-fix cycle (max 5 iterations)
*qa-loop-review                # Resume loop from review step
*qa-loop-fix                   # Resume loop from fix step
*stop-qa-loop                  # Pause loop and save state
*resume-qa-loop                # Resume loop from saved state
*escalate-qa-loop              # Force manual escalation
```

## Planning & Epics

```
@pm *create-epic               # Create a new epic from requirements
@pm *execute-epic              # Execute an epic (triggers story creation flow)
@pm *create-doc prd            # Generate a PRD document from template
@sm *draft                     # Create a new story from epic/PRD
@po *validate-story-draft      # Validate story (10-point checklist)
```

---

## Architecture & Research

```
@architect *create-full-stack-architecture    # Generate full architecture docs
@architect *execute-checklist architect-checklist  # Run architecture review
@analyst *research                            # Run structured research task
```

---

## IDS (Incremental Development System)

```
*ids check {intent}            # Should this be REUSE, ADAPT, or CREATE?
*ids impact {entity-id}        # Analyze impact of modifying an entity
*ids register {file-path}      # Register a new entity in the IDS registry
*ids health                    # Health check on the IDS registry
```

---

## Framework Management (@aios-master / Orion)

```
*workflow SDC                  # Start the Story Development Cycle workflow
*workflow spec-pipeline        # Start the Spec Pipeline workflow
*list-agents                   # List all available agents
*validate-agents               # Validate all agent definitions
*ids stats                     # Show IDS registry statistics
```

## Execution Modes

When calling `@dev *develop`, you can specify the execution mode:

| Mode | Prompts | Best For |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Interactive** (default) | 5-10, with checkpoints | Learning, complex decisions |
| **YOLO** | 0-1, fully autonomous | Simple tasks, trusted context |
| **Pre-Flight** | 10-15 upfront, then zero | Ambiguous requirements, critical work |

```
@dev *develop {story-id}              # Interactive (default)
@dev *develop {story-id} --yolo       # YOLO mode
@dev *develop {story-id} --pre-flight # Pre-Flight mode
```

---

## Story Status Progression

```
Draft → Ready → InProgress → InReview → Done
```

| Transition | Who | How |
|------------|-----|-----|
| Draft → Ready | @po | `*validate-story-draft` (GO verdict) |
| Ready → InProgress | @dev | `*develop {story-id}` |
| InProgress → InReview | @qa | `*qa-gate` |
| InReview → Done | @devops | `*push` |

---

## CodeRabbit Self-Healing (Dev Phase)

AIOS runs CodeRabbit automatically during `@dev *develop`. You do not need to invoke it manually.

| Severity | Dev Phase | QA Phase |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| CRITICAL | Auto-fix (max 2 iterations) | Auto-fix (max 3 iterations) |
| HIGH | Auto-fix or document as debt | Auto-fix or document as debt |
| MEDIUM | Document as tech debt | Document as tech debt |
| LOW | Ignored | Ignored |
