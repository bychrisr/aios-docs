# Universal Commands

These commands are available in every AIOS agent at any time. They provide contextual help, system status, and session control regardless of which agent is active.

## Help and Information

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `*help` | Show all available commands for the current agent |
| `*status` | Display current context: active agent, story, task state |
| `*guide` | Show a detailed usage guide for the currently active agent |

### Example Usage

```bash
# See what commands @qa can execute
@qa *help

# Check which story you are working on and its current status
*status

# Get a detailed walkthrough of @sm's capabilities
@sm *guide
```

---

## Session Control

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `*exit` | End the session with the current agent |
| `*yolo` | Toggle permission mode: `ask` (confirm each action), `auto` (no confirmation), `explore` (discovery mode) |
| `*chat-mode` | Start free-form conversation mode for brainstorming and questions |

### Example Usage

```bash
# Allow Dex to execute without asking for confirmation on each step
@dev *yolo

# End the session with the current agent
*exit
```

---

## Tips

- Address an agent before running its commands: `@dev *help` activates Dex and shows his commands
- `*status` is your fastest way to reorient after switching agents
- `*guide` gives more context than `*help` — use it when learning a new agent's capabilities
