# Specialized Agent Commands

Each AIOS agent has its own set of commands for its domain. Use the agent handle to address them directly.

For a single-page quick reference, see the [Cheat Sheet](/playbook/cheat-sheet). For agent personas and roles, see [Agents at a Glance](/playbook/agents).

## Delegation Rules

AIOS enforces strict delegation patterns. Key rules:

- Any agent that needs to push code MUST delegate to `@devops *push`
- @architect decides technology; @data-engineer implements DDL
- @sm creates stories; @po validates them — neither can do the other's job
- @aios-master (Orion) can override boundaries when necessary for framework health
