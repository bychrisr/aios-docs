# AIOS Command Reference

The central guide for interacting with AIOS agents through commands. Commands are the most direct way to instruct agents, orchestrate workflows, and manage the development lifecycle.

## Command Philosophy

AIOS uses explicit orchestration. Each agent responds to a defined set of commands and delegates tasks outside its authority to the appropriate specialist.

- **Universal Commands** — Available in every agent at any time (`*help`, `*status`, `*guide`)
- **Master Agent Commands** — Framework management, workflow orchestration, IDS operations (@aios-master / Orion)
- **Specialized Commands** — Domain-specific actions per agent (@dev, @qa, @pm, @sm, @po, @architect, etc.)

## How to Navigate This Section

- **[Universal Commands](./universal-commands)** — Start here if you are new to AIOS
- **[Master Agent Commands](./master-agent-commands)** — Workflow execution and framework management
- **[Specialized Commands](./specialized-commands)** — Commands organized by agent
