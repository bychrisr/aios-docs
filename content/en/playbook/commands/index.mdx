# AIOS Command Reference

Welcome to the Synkra AIOS command reference. This section of the playbook is your central guide for interacting with the framework through the command line.

Commands are the most direct and powerful way to instruct AI agents, orchestrate workflows, and manage the software development lifecycle.

## Command Philosophy

AIOS adopts an "explicit orchestration" approach. Instead of trying to guess complex intentions, the system exposes a rich set of commands that can be combined to achieve precise results.

- **Universal Commands:** A set of essential commands available in any context.
- **Master Agent Commands:** High-level actions for framework management, workflow orchestration, and meta-operations.
- **Specialized Commands:** Domain-specific actions delegated to specialist agents like `@dev`, `@qa`, and `@architect`.

## How to Navigate This Section

To make it easier to look up information, we have divided the command reference into the following pages:

- **[Universal Commands](./universal-commands):** Essential commands like `*help` and `*status`. Start here if you are new to AIOS.
- **[Master Agent Commands](./master-agent-commands):** The main control panel for orchestrating AIOS.
- **[Specialized Commands](./specialized-commands):** An overview of how commands are delegated to specialist agents.

Use the navigation menu to explore each section in detail.
