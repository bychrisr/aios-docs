## Delegation Patterns

The most common delegation flows:

```
@sm *draft → @po *validate-story-draft → @dev *develop → @qa *qa-gate → @devops *push

@pm *create-epic → @pm *execute-epic → @sm *draft (per story)

@architect (architecture decision) → @data-engineer (database implementation)

ANY agent (needs to push) → @devops *push
```
