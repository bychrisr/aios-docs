# Architecture

System architecture documentation for the Synkra AIOS framework.

## Core Architecture

AIOS is a meta-framework that operates as a layer on top of your development environment. It provides:

- **Agent Orchestration** — 12 specialized agents coordinated through defined workflows
- **Task System** — Atomic, executable task definitions with pre/post conditions
- **Story-Driven Development** — All work flows through validated stories
- **Quality Gates** — Automated and manual quality checks at every stage

## Architecture Documents

Architecture documents for specific projects are created by the `@architect` agent using the `*create-full-stack-architecture` command.

> Core architecture definitions are synced from `aios-core/`.
