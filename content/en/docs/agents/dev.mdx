# Dex — Developer

**Archetype:** Builder | **Agent ID:** `@dev`

Dex is the Full Stack Developer of the AIOS framework. Responsible for implementing user stories, debugging, refactoring, and applying development best practices. Dex operates with a pragmatic, solution-oriented approach, implementing stories precisely while maintaining comprehensive test coverage.

## Core Capabilities

- **Story Implementation** — Develop complete user stories with three execution modes (YOLO, Interactive, Pre-flight)
- **Code Quality** — Improve code formatting, linting, and modern syntax patterns
- **Performance Optimization** — Analyze and optimize code performance
- **Refactoring** — Suggest and apply automated refactoring opportunities
- **QA Fix Application** — Apply corrections based on QA feedback
- **Technical Debt Tracking** — Register and manage technical debt in the backlog
- **CodeRabbit Self-Healing** — Automated code review with self-fix loop (max 2 iterations)

## Key Commands

### Development Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `*develop {story-id}` | Implement a complete story (default: Interactive mode) |
| `*develop {story-id} yolo` | Implement autonomously with 0-1 prompts |
| `*develop {story-id} preflight` | Plan everything upfront, then execute with zero ambiguity |
| `*run-tests` | Execute linting and tests |

### Quality Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `*apply-qa-fixes` | Apply corrections from QA feedback |
| `*improve-code-quality {path}` | Improve code quality (formatting, linting, modern syntax) |
| `*optimize-performance {path}` | Analyze and optimize code performance |
| `*suggest-refactoring {path}` | Suggest automated refactoring opportunities |

### Backlog and Documentation

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `*backlog-debt` | Register technical debt in the backlog |
| `*sync-documentation` | Synchronize documentation with code changes |
| `*validate-story-draft` | Validate story draft quality and completeness |

## Execution Modes

| Mode | When to Use | Prompts |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **YOLO** | Simple, deterministic tasks | 0-1 |
| **Interactive** (default) | Learning opportunities, complex decisions | 5-10 |
| **Pre-flight** | Ambiguous requirements, critical work | All upfront |

## Workflow Participation

- **Story Development Cycle (SDC)** — Phase 3: Implementation. Receives validated stories from @po, implements code, writes tests, and passes to @qa for review
- **QA Loop** — Receives fix requests from @qa, applies corrections, and submits for re-review
- **Greenfield and Brownfield workflows** — Participates in all 6 workflow variants (full-stack, service, UI)

## Git Permissions

**Allowed operations:** `git add`, `git commit`, `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, `git branch`, `git checkout`, `git merge`

**Blocked operations (delegate to @devops):** `git push`, `git push --force`, `gh pr create`, `gh pr merge`

## When to Use This Agent

**Use @dev when you need to:**
- Implement approved user stories
- Apply QA fix requests
- Refactor existing code
- Optimize performance
- Register technical debt
- Run and validate tests

**Do not use @dev when:**
- Creating stories (use @sm)
- Pushing to remote (use @devops)
- Validating architecture (use @architect)
- Managing backlog priorities (use @po)
