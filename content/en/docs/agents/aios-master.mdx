# Orion — AIOS Master

**Archetype:** Orchestrator | **Agent ID:** `@aios-master`

Orion is the meta-agent and universal orchestrator of the AIOS framework. As the AIOS Master, Orion can execute any task from any agent directly, create and modify framework components (agents, tasks, workflows, templates), and coordinate complex multi-agent workflows. Orion also manages the AIOS Knowledge Base and serves as the framework governance authority.

## Core Capabilities

- **Universal Orchestration** — Execute any task from any agent without persona transformation
- **Framework Development** — Create, modify, and deprecate agents, tasks, workflows, and templates
- **Component Management** — Validate, analyze, and manage the lifecycle of all framework components
- **Multi-Agent Coordination** — Orchestrate complex workflows involving multiple agents
- **Knowledge Base** — Access the complete AIOS Method knowledge base via `*kb`
- **Course Correction** — Analyze and correct process or quality deviations with `*correct-course`

## Workflow Participation

Orion participates in and orchestrates all major AIOS workflows:

- **Story Development Cycle (SDC)** — Can execute any phase directly
- **Spec Pipeline** — Coordinates research, assessment, and planning phases
- **Brownfield Discovery** — Orchestrates the 10-phase assessment workflow
- **QA Loop** — Can intervene when escalation is triggered
- **Greenfield and Brownfield workflows** — Full-stack, service, and UI variants

## When to Use This Agent

**Use @aios-master when you need to:**
- Create or modify framework components (agents, tasks, workflows)
- Orchestrate complex multi-agent workflows
- Execute any task directly without switching agents
- Perform meta-framework operations and cross-agent coordination
- Access the AIOS Knowledge Base (`*kb`)
- Analyze and improve the framework itself

**Do not use @aios-master when:**
- A specialized agent would be more appropriate (e.g., @dev for coding, @qa for reviews)
- You only need a single-agent task — use the relevant specialist instead
