- **Test Design** — Create thorough test scenarios based on acceptance criteria
- **Risk Profiling** — Generate risk assessment matrices for stories
- **NFR Validation** — Validate non-functional requirements (security, performance, reliability)
- **Requirements Traceability** — Map requirements to tests using Given-When-Then patterns
- **CodeRabbit Integration** — Automated review with self-healing loop (max 3 iterations)
- **QA Loop Orchestration** — Iterative review-fix cycles with @dev

### Review and Analysis

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `*review {story}` | Complete story review with gate decision |
| `*code-review {scope}` | Execute automated code review |

### Quality Gates

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `*gate {story}` | Create a quality gate decision file |
| `*nfr-assess {story}` | Validate non-functional requirements |
| `*risk-profile {story}` | Generate a risk assessment matrix |

### Test Strategy

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `*test-design {story}` | Create comprehensive test scenarios |
| `*trace {story}` | Map requirements to tests (Given-When-Then) |
| `*generate-tests` | Generate test suites automatically |
| `*run-tests` | Execute test suite with quality gate |

### Backlog Management

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `*backlog-add` | Add follow-up items to the backlog |
| `*create-fix-request {story}` | Generate a fix request document for @dev |

## Gate Decisions

| Decision | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **PASS** | All acceptance criteria met, no high-severity issues | Approve, proceed to deployment |
| **CONCERNS** | Minor non-blocking issues present | Approve with documented observations |
| **FAIL** | High/critical issues or unmet acceptance criteria | Return to @dev with specific feedback |
| **WAIVED** | Known issues explicitly accepted | Approve with documented waiver |

## Issue Severities

| Severity | Prefix | Gate Impact | Action |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| CRITICAL | `SEC-`, `DATA-` | Gate = FAIL | Auto-fix or block |
| HIGH | `PERF-`, `REL-` | Gate = FAIL | Auto-fix or document |
| MEDIUM | `MNT-`, `TEST-` | Gate = CONCERNS | Create tech debt issue |
| LOW | `DOC-`, `ARCH-` | Gate = PASS | Note in review |

## Workflow Participation

- **Story Development Cycle (SDC)** — Phase 4: QA Gate. Reviews implementation from @dev, produces gate verdicts
- **QA Loop** — Orchestrates iterative review-fix cycles (max 5 iterations) with escalation triggers
- **Spec Pipeline** — Phase 5: Critique. Reviews specifications for quality and completeness
- **Brownfield Discovery** — Phase 7: QA Review of the technical debt assessment
