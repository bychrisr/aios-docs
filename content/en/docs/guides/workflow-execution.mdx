# Workflow Execution

How AIOS workflows orchestrate multi-agent development.

## Core Principle

Workflows are composed of **tasks connected together**, not agents. Each task defines inputs, outputs, pre/post-conditions, and execution modes. Agents are the default executors.

## Available Workflows

| Workflow | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Story Development Cycle | Primary development workflow |
| QA Loop | Iterative review-fix cycle |
| Spec Pipeline | Requirements → executable spec |
| Brownfield Discovery | Legacy codebase assessment |

## Workflow Selection

| Situation | Workflow |
|-----------|---------|
| New story from epic | Story Development Cycle |
| QA found issues | QA Loop |
| Complex feature needs spec | Spec Pipeline → SDC |
| Joining existing project | Brownfield Discovery |
| Simple bug fix | SDC (YOLO mode) |

## Execution Modes

### Guided Mode
Manual persona-switch between agents. The orchestrator tells you which agent to activate next.

### Engine Mode
Real subagent spawning — agents are automatically dispatched in sequence.

## Starting a Workflow

```
@aios-master
> *workflow greenfield-fullstack
```

Or for specific workflows:

```
> *workflow story-development-cycle
> *workflow brownfield-discovery
```

## Workflow Configuration

Workflows are defined as YAML files in `.aios-core/development/workflows/`. Each workflow specifies:

- **Phases** with sequential steps
- **Agent assignments** per step
- **Artifacts** produced at each phase
- **Gate conditions** for progression
