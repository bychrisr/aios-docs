# Introduction to AIOS

Synkra AIOS (AI Operating System) is a meta-agent framework that transforms Claude into a complete software development team. This guide covers the fundamental concepts, installation, and first steps with the system.

## Prerequisites

Before installing AIOS, make sure your environment meets the minimum requirements:

| Requirement | Minimum Version | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Node.js | 18+ | Check with `node --version` |
| npm | 9+ | Included with Node.js 18+ |
| Git | Any | Recommended for version control |
| Disk space | 1 GB | For the framework and dependencies |

You also need an API key from a supported AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or another supported provider).

## Installation

Initialize AIOS in a new project with a single command:

```bash
npx @synkra/aios-core init my-project
```

To install in an existing project, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
cd my-project
npx @synkra/aios-core init .
```

The installer creates the complete framework structure and configures all necessary files automatically.

## Project Structure

After installation, your project will have the following structure:

```
my-project/
├── .aios/
│   ├── config.json          # Main configuration
│   ├── data/                # Persistent data and memory
│   └── cache/               # Analysis cache
├── .aios-core/
│   ├── agents/              # 12 agent definitions
│   ├── workflows/           # Automated workflows
│   ├── tasks/               # Task definitions
│   ├── templates/           # Story and document templates
│   ├── scripts/             # Automation scripts
│   └── docs/                # Internal framework documentation
├── docs/
│   ├── stories/             # Stories and epics
│   └── qa/                  # QA reports
└── .env                     # API keys (do not commit)
```

The `.aios/` and `.aios-core/` directories contain all framework logic. The `docs/` directory is where project artifacts are generated.

## Configuration

### Main Configuration File

The `.aios/config.json` file controls framework behavior:

```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "my-project",
    "type": "web-app"
  },
  "ai": {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
  },
  "features": {
    "memory": true,
    "learning": true,
    "codeReview": true
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

Configure your API keys in the `.env` file:

```bash
# AI Provider (required)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# or
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Optional
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...
```

**Important:** Never commit the `.env` file. It is already in `.gitignore` by default.

## Understanding the Meta-Agent

AIOS operates as a **meta-agent** -- a system that coordinates multiple specialized agents. Its capabilities include:

- **Self-analysis:** Examines the codebase to understand patterns, dependencies, and architecture
- **Code generation:** Produces code following patterns identified in the project
- **Pattern learning:** Detects and registers recurring patterns for reuse
- **Self-evolution:** Adapts its strategies based on decision history

The meta-agent is not just a code assistant -- it maintains long-term context, manages the complete story lifecycle, and ensures consistency across all agents.

## Basic Commands

All AIOS commands use the `*` (asterisk) prefix:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `*help` | Lists all available commands |
| `*status` | Shows the current project state and active agents |
| `*config` | Displays or modifies configuration |
| `*list-agents` | Lists all agents and their status |
| `*activate` | Activates an agent's activation pipeline |
| `*analyze` | Runs codebase analysis |
| `*suggest` | Generates improvement suggestions |
| `*learn` | Starts a pattern learning cycle |

For detailed help on any command, use `*help {command}`.

## Agent System

AIOS provides 12 specialized agents, each with specific responsibilities and authority. To activate an agent, use the `@agent-name` syntax.

### Management Agents

| Agent | Role | Responsibilities |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| `@pm` | Project Manager | Epic creation, spec pipeline, overall orchestration |
| `@po` | Product Owner | Story validation, backlog prioritization, context tracking |
| `@sm` | Scrum Master | Story creation, template selection, facilitation |

### Technical Agents

| Agent | Role | Responsibilities |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| `@dev` | Developer | Code implementation, commits, task execution |
| `@architect` | System Architect | Architecture decisions, technology selection, complexity assessment |
| `@data-engineer` | Data Engineer | Schema design, query optimization, migrations |
| `@devops` | DevOps Engineer | Git push, PRs, CI/CD, MCP management |

### Quality and Analysis Agents

| Agent | Role | Responsibilities |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| `@qa` | Quality Assurance | Quality gate, code review, testing |
| `@analyst` | Business Analyst | Research, requirements analysis, reports |
| `@ux-design-expert` | UX Designer | Frontend specifications, interface evaluation |

### Governance Agent

| Agent | Role | Responsibilities |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| `@aios-master` | Framework Governor | Constitutional governance, can execute any task, conflict mediation |

## Memory Layer

AIOS has a persistent memory system that supports semantic and keyword search. Memory stores decisions, learned patterns, and project context.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `*memory status` | Checks memory state and statistics |
| `*memory search {query}` | Searches memory for relevant terms |
| `*memory rebuild` | Rebuilds memory indexes |
| `*memory clear-cache` | Clears cache without deleting persistent data |

Memory supports two search modes:

- **Semantic search:** Finds content by meaning, even with different terms
- **Keyword search:** Exact matching for specific terms

## Best Practices

1. **Start small:** Begin with one agent (`@dev`) and gradually expand to full workflows
2. **Use descriptive names:** Stories, epics, and branches with clear names make navigation easier
3. **Leverage memory:** Run `*analyze` regularly to keep the project context up to date
4. **Analyze frequently:** Use `*suggest` to identify continuous improvement opportunities
5. **Follow the workflows:** The full cycle (create, validate, implement, review) exists to ensure quality
6. **Document decisions:** The decision log (`decision-log`) is essential for traceability

## Troubleshooting

### Node.js not found or wrong version

```bash
# Check installed version
node --version

# If below 18, update via nvm
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

### API key errors

If you receive authentication errors, check:

1. The `.env` file exists at the project root
2. The key is in the correct format for the chosen provider
3. The key has available credits/quota

### Memory issues

If memory is slow or returning incorrect results:

```bash
# Rebuild the indexes
*memory rebuild

# If it persists, clear the cache
*memory clear-cache
```

### Initialization errors

If `npx @synkra/aios-core init` fails:

```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Try again with verbose flag
npx @synkra/aios-core init my-project --verbose
```
