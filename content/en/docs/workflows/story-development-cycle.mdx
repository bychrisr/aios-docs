# Story Development Cycle

The primary workflow for all development work in AIOS.

## Overview

The Story Development Cycle (SDC) is a 4-phase workflow that takes a story from creation through validation, implementation, and quality assurance.

```
@sm Draft → @po Validate → @dev Implement → @qa Review
```

## Phase 1: Create

**Agent:** @sm (Scrum Master)

- Creates story from epic/PRD context
- Applies story template
- Sets initial status to **Draft**

## Phase 2: Validate

**Agent:** @po (Product Owner)

- Runs 10-point validation checklist
- Verifies acceptance criteria are testable
- Checks alignment with PRD and epic
- **Decision:** GO (≥7/10) or NO-GO
- On GO: Status changes to **Ready**

## Phase 3: Implement

**Agent:** @dev (Developer)

- Picks up **Ready** stories
- Three execution modes: YOLO, Interactive, Pre-Flight
- CodeRabbit self-healing (max 2 iterations)
- Status: Ready → **InProgress**
- On completion: Status → **InReview**

## Phase 4: QA Gate

**Agent:** @qa (QA Engineer)

- 7 quality checks (code, tests, AC, regressions, perf, security, docs)
- **Verdicts:** PASS, CONCERNS, FAIL, WAIVED
- PASS → @devops pushes, status → **Done**
- FAIL → Returns to @dev via QA Loop

## After QA

If QA passes, the story is handed to @devops for git push and PR creation. If QA fails, the QA Loop engages for iterative fixes (max 5 iterations).
