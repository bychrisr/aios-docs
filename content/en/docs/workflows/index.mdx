# Workflows

AIOS provides 4 primary workflows that orchestrate development from requirements to deployment.

## Primary Workflows

### 1. [Story Development Cycle (SDC)](/docs/workflows/story-development-cycle)
The main development workflow: Create → Validate → Implement → QA Gate.

### 2. [QA Loop](/docs/workflows/qa-loop)
Iterative review-fix cycle after initial QA gate (max 5 iterations).

### 3. [Spec Pipeline](/docs/workflows/spec-pipeline)
Transform informal requirements into executable specifications.

### 4. Brownfield Discovery
10-phase technical debt assessment for existing codebases.
