# About Synkra AIOS

**Synkra AIOS** (AI-Orchestrated System) is a meta-framework for full stack development that orchestrates 12 specialized AI agents to handle complex development workflows.

## Vision

Transform software development by providing an intelligent orchestration layer that coordinates specialized AI agents, enabling teams to work faster, with higher quality, and with less cognitive overhead.

## Core Principles

- **Agent Specialization** — Each agent has a distinct role and expertise
- **Story-Driven Development** — All work is traceable through stories
- **Quality First** — Automated quality gates at every stage
- **Incremental Development (IDS)** — REUSE > ADAPT > CREATE
- **Constitutional Governance** — Framework rules are enforced consistently
