# About Synkra AIOS

**Synkra AIOS** (AI-Orchestrated System) is an AI-powered operating system for software development. It provides an intelligent orchestration layer that coordinates 13 specialized AI agents to handle complex development workflows -- from requirements gathering to deployment.

---

## What is Synkra AIOS?

Synkra AIOS is a meta-framework that transforms how software teams work. Instead of using AI as a simple code assistant, AIOS provides a structured system where specialized agents collaborate through defined workflows, quality gates, and governance rules.

At its core, AIOS is built around the **meta-agent** concept: an AI that understands its own codebase and can analyze, generate, and improve code based on learned patterns and team conventions.

## Key Features

- **13 Specialized Agents** -- Each agent has a distinct role: developer (@dev), architect (@architect), QA (@qa), project manager (@pm), product owner (@po), scrum master (@sm), DevOps (@devops), data engineer (@data-engineer), UX expert (@ux-design-expert), analyst (@analyst), squad creator (@squad-creator / Nova), and the framework governor (@aios-master)
- **4 Primary Workflows** -- Story Development Cycle (SDC), QA Loop, Spec Pipeline, and Brownfield Discovery
- **Automated Quality Gates** -- 10-point story validation, 7-point QA gate, and CodeRabbit self-healing integration
- **Template Engine V2** -- Standardized templates for stories, epics, architecture docs, and agent definitions
- **Constitutional Governance** -- Framework rules enforced consistently across all agents
- **IDS Principles** -- Incremental Development System: REUSE over ADAPT over CREATE
- **Memory Layer** -- Semantic indexing and context management for intelligent code understanding
- **Multi-Agent Squads** -- Create custom teams of agents for domain-specific workflows

## Who is it For?

| Audience | How AIOS Helps |
|----------|---------------|
| **Solo developers** | Provides structured workflows, automated quality checks, and AI-assisted code review |
| **Development teams** | Coordinates work through stories, sprints, and quality gates with clear agent responsibilities |
| **Enterprise teams** | Offers governance, traceability, and audit trails through constitutional rules and the IDS framework |
| **Tech leads and architects** | Supports system design, brownfield assessment, and architectural decision-making |

## How it Works

1. **Install** -- Initialize AIOS in your project with `npx @synkra/aios-core init`
2. **Activate agents** -- Choose the agent for your current task (e.g., `@dev` for development, `@pm` for project management)
3. **Execute workflows** -- Run structured workflows like the Story Development Cycle or Spec Pipeline
4. **Quality gates** -- Automated checklists and code review ensure every artifact meets quality standards
5. **Ship** -- Delegate push and deployment operations to @devops

The meta-agent learns from your development patterns and improves its assistance over time.

## Core Principles

- **Agent Specialization** -- Each agent has a distinct role and expertise with clear authority boundaries
- **Story-Driven Development** -- All work is traceable through stories linked to epics and PRDs
- **Quality First** -- Automated quality gates at every stage of the development lifecycle
- **Incremental Development (IDS)** -- REUSE existing artifacts before adapting or creating new ones
- **Constitutional Governance** -- Framework rules are enforced consistently, including the "No Invention" rule (Article IV)
