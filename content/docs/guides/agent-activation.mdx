# Agent Activation

Learn how to activate and interact with AIOS agents.

## Activation Syntax

Agents are activated using the `@agent-name` pattern:

```
@dev          — Developer agent (Dex)
@qa           — QA agent
@architect    — Architect agent (Aria)
@pm           — Product Manager (Morgan)
@po           — Product Owner (Pax)
@sm           — Scrum Master (River)
@analyst      — Business Analyst (Atlas)
@devops       — DevOps (Gage)
@data-engineer — Data Engineer (Dara)
@ux-design-expert — UX Designer (Uma)
@aios-master  — Master Orchestrator (Orion)
```

## How It Works

1. Type `@agent-name` to activate the agent persona
2. The agent loads its configuration and greets you
3. Use `*command` syntax to execute agent-specific commands
4. Type `*exit` to deactivate the agent

## Common Commands

Every agent supports these base commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `*help` | Show all available commands |
| `*guide` | Show comprehensive usage guide |
| `*session-info` | Current session details |
| `*yolo` | Toggle permission mode |
| `*exit` | Exit agent mode |

## Example Session

```
> @dev
🛠️ Dex (Builder) ready. Let's build!

> *develop
Starting story development...

> *exit
Exiting dev mode.
```
