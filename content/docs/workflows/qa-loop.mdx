# QA Loop

Automated review-fix cycle for iterative quality improvement.

## Overview

The QA Loop runs after the initial QA gate when issues are found. It automates the back-and-forth between QA review and developer fixes.

```
@qa review → verdict → @dev fixes → re-review (max 5 iterations)
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `*qa-loop {storyId}` | Start QA loop |
| `*qa-loop-review` | Resume from review |
| `*qa-loop-fix` | Resume from fix |
| `*stop-qa-loop` | Pause and save state |
| `*resume-qa-loop` | Resume from saved state |
| `*escalate-qa-loop` | Force escalation |

## Verdicts

| Verdict | Action |
|---------|--------|
| APPROVE | Complete, mark story Done |
| REJECT | @dev fixes, then re-review |
| BLOCKED | Escalate immediately |

## Configuration

- **Max iterations:** 5
- **Status tracking:** `qa/loop-status.json`

## Escalation Triggers

The loop escalates automatically when:

- Maximum iterations reached (default: 5)
- Verdict is BLOCKED
- Fix attempt fails
- Manual escalation via `*escalate-qa-loop`

## CodeRabbit Integration

During the QA Loop, CodeRabbit runs in full mode with up to 3 self-healing iterations. CRITICAL and HIGH severity issues trigger automatic fixes before manual QA analysis.
