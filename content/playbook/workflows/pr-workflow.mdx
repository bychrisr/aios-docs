# Standard PR Workflow

The standard pull request workflow in AIOS projects.

## Creating a PR

After development and QA gate pass:

```
@devops *push
```

The DevOps agent handles:
1. Creating the feature branch (if not already on one)
2. Pushing to remote
3. Creating the pull request with proper description

## PR Checklist

## Code Review

## Merging

After approval:
